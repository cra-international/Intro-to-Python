    "\n",
    "* In  the `get_rps()` function, only allow the user to give a valid response. To do this, place your existing code into a While loop. Then if the user gives a valid response, return the user's response, which will automatically exist the While Loop. If the response is not valid, then print `\"Sorry, that's not a valid response. Please try again.\"`. The While Loop will force the user to keep responding until they provide valid input.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Currently, the user has to rerun the `play_rps()` function every time they wish to play a game of Rock, Paper, Python. Update the `play_rps()` function so that the user plays indefinitely. At the end of each game, ask the user if they wish to stop playing and then end the game if they say they'd like to stop. If the user indicates they'd like to continue, print some statistics about the previous games, such as wins, losses, ties, and how many times they've played each of \"rock\", \"paper\", and \"scissors\" before starting the next game.\n",

    "* In the above game, the computer selects \"rock\", \"paper\", or \"scissors\" at random, which is the optimal strategy in Rock, Paper, Scissors. In real life, however, people are rarely able to be completely random. Update the computer's strategy so that at the very start it selects one of \"rock\", \"paper\", or \"scissors\" to chose with 40% probability and the other two with 30% probability for the following games. (You'll need to have incorporated the above two extensions for this to work). Make this selection random so that each time you start up Rock, Paper, Python, you don't know which play the computer will be favoring. Then play against the computer. Can you identify the tell? Once you've identified it, what's your optimal strategy?"
