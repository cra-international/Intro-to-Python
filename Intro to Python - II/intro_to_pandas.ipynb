At the end, we covered packages which are importable Python obejcts with defined methods and attributes. We looked at the `math` package, we includes relevant mathmatical functions like `log10()` and `gcd()`. We also looked at the `random` package, with allowed us to create random variables. \n",

    "In this case, we specify the keyword argument `columns` within the call to the `.rename()` method and pass a *dictionary* as the value of the argument. The dictionary is structured so that the *key* is the existing column name and the *value* is the new column name. This dictionary contains multiple key-value pairs corresponding to two column name changes we intend to make. The result of the `.rename()` method is a new DataFrame with the updated column names. In this case, we update the `sales_df` variable by assigning that new DataFrame to the existing variable `sales_df`. "
