Since there are 8 bits in a byte, that means the largest value an int64 can be is $2^{64}$, which is typically plenty large enough. `float64` is simlar, but for floats and `bool` is a column of boolean values. \n",
    "\n",
    "How are strings stored? Strings are stored using the `object` data type. It's important to note that while all string columns are stored as `object`s, not all `object` columns are strings. For example, we may have a column of *mixed* values, say strings and numbers. That type of column will be cast as an `object` type, essentially converting the numbers in column to text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there is one type of datatype we haven't encountered before, and that's the `datetime64` type. `datetime` objects are built-in Python storage objects that allow for easy creation, manipulation, and storage of dates.
