# Tech Lab: Intro to Python - Parts I and II

Welcome to Intro to Python! In this repository you'll find all the materials you'll need to get started. 

To download the materials, simply click on the green "Clone or download" button on the top right-hand side of this page and then select "Download ZIP". From there, just unzip the folder on your computer, preferably to somewhere in your "Documents" folder. In order to access these files, you'll need to install the Anaconda distribution. If you do not already have this installed, contact IT to get the Anaconda distribution installed on your computer. 

After you've installed Anaconda, we will cover opening the files stored in this repository at the beginning of "Intro to Python - Part I". 

If you have trouble installing Anaconda, you can also run these files by clicking the "launch binder" button below. This will build an online Python environment for you to run the demo materials.
