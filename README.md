# Intro-to-Python

Welcome to Intro to Python! In this repository, you'll find all the materials you'll need to get started. To download the materials, simply click on the green "Clone or download" button on the top right-hand side of this page and then select "Download ZIP". From there, just unzip the folder on your computer, preferably to somewhere in your "Documents" folder. In order to access these files, you'll need to install the Anaconda distribution. If you do not already have this installed, navigate to [this page](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#windows) and then click the "64-Bit Graphical Installer" button under "Python 3.7" and "Windows". This will download the Python 3.7 Anaconda installer for Windows. Once downloaded, run the installer and accept all default settings. The whole process should take around 15-20 minutes. 

After you've installed Anaconda, we will cover opening the files stored in this repository at the beginning of "Intro to Python - Part I". 

If you have trouble installing Anaconda, you can also run these files by clicking the "launch binder" button below. This will build an online Python environment for you to run the demo materials.
