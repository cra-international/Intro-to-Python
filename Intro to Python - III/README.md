This repository contains all of the materials for **Intro to Python - Part III**. File descriptions are below. After some additional editing, these files can be used to create a texMe package that can be used to text you with a message!

- **textMe.py**
	- This file is the main Python file associated with the textMe Python package. This file includes one function, `textme`, which texts the user.
- **setup.py**
	- This is a configuration file that tells the Python package builder what version the package is and other additional inforomation about the package.
- **requirements.txt**
	- This folder contains a list of the other Python packages the textMe package depends upon. These are also called *dependencies*.

Enjoy!
